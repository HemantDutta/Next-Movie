## About
Next Movie is a mini-project aimed at exploring the features of Next.js 12 while interacting with a comprehensive movie database API. Through this project, we delve into various aspects of Next.js and showcase its capabilities in building dynamic web applications.

## Technologies & Concepts Learned
During the development of Next Movie, I learned the following key concepts and technologies:

- Next.js 12: Next.js is a powerful React framework that allows for easy building of static and server-side rendered React applications. Version 12 introduces several exciting features and enhancements.

- Static Site Generating: Next.js enables the generation of static websites, which enhances performance and allows for easy deployment.

- Data Fetching & Pre-rendering: Next.js supports pre-rendering of pages with data fetching capabilities, ensuring fast loading times and improved user experience.

- getStaticProps(): This Next.js function allows for data fetching at build time and pre-rendering of static pages.

- getStaticPaths(): Used for dynamic routing and generating static paths based on data.

- File-based Routing: Next.js simplifies routing by allowing developers to organize pages based on file structure, which enhances code readability and maintainability.

- Dynamic Routing: Next.js supports dynamic routing, enabling the creation of dynamic pages based on URL parameters.

- Path Fallback: Next.js provides fallback behavior for dynamic routes, ensuring a smooth user experience even for pages that haven't been pre-rendered.

- Dynamic Parameters: Next.js allows for the creation of pages with dynamic parameters, enabling the customization of content based on user input.

- Incremental Static Regeneration: Next.js 12 introduces incremental static regeneration, which enables the regeneration of static pages on-demand, ensuring up-to-date content while maintaining performance.
